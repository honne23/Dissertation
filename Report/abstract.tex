\chapter*{Abstract}

The protein structure prediction (PSP) problem  is the search for a 
function that maps a proteins primary structure, 
composed of a string of discrete amino acid residues to 
their respective native conformation in 
3D space denoted as the protein's tertiary structure. 
Recent breakthroughs in the field have utilize 
techniques such as multiple sequence alignment 
coupled with residual convolutional neural networks 
to derive candidate posteriors over the distribution 
of inter-residue distances from which multiple 
energetically favourable tertiary structures can be 
generated; these results are typically annealed to produce 
a structure of lowest conformational energy. In this work 
I examine PSP within the context of multi-agent agent games
by applying newly developed game theoretic techniques 
that do not rely on pre-existing datasets.
Ultimately, my experiments proved unsuccesful however
my research shows that mean field games have the potential
to succefully model the PSP problem and overcome common
difficulties in the field such as the curse of dimensionality
as well as horizontal scalability. The system
I propose is one that effectively incorporates inductive bias 
into the problem formulation in an effort to provide
a richer training signal to the learning agents. 
Additional techniques such as 
reward shaping and risk-sensitive learning are also
applied to reduce the sample complexity of the
conformational search space.
